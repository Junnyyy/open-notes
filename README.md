# Open Notes 📔

"Open Notes" are open-source computer science notes. We firmly believe that information, especially information that can aid people in achieving success, should not be concealed.

Currently, these notes exclusively cover computer science courses at the University of Houston. However, our ultimate objective is to expand our reach to encompass all educational institutions.

_Notes are created independently by students and authors. While we make our best effort to ensure quality, we cannot guarantee their accuracy._

# Usage 🔨

For the majority of our notes, we provide both the source Markdown and compiled PDF versions. In most cases, the PDF versions should suffice for your needs.

If you're interested or wish to contribute, we strongly recommend using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Obsidian offers robust support for Markdown, LaTeX, plugins, and a host of other features. Our notes are primarily in Markdown, although they may include formatting elements like LaTeX, which are best viewed in the Markdown format.

#### Structure

The notes have a specific file structure to make navigation easier.

```
(Course Name [Course Number])/(Professor)
```
